CS 425 Assignment 1

## Programming Questions
1. Simulate an LIF neuron with different input currents and plot the membrane potential, showing 
  (a) potential decay over time and
  (b) spiking behavior.
2. Plot the firing rate as a function of the input current.
3. What happens to the firing rate as you continue to increase the input current? Why?
4. Simulate a neuron using the Izhikevich model.
5. Simulate a neuron using the Hodgkin-Huxley model.
